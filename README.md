# Minecraft Asset Extractor

Why? In minecraft some assets like [Sound](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sounds.json) cannot be extracted from the jar file because they exist in somewhere in the `.minecraft/assets/objects`, this directory is not human readable.

1. Select the `.minecraft/assets` folder in `%appdata%`, or other install location.
2. Click one of the index files
3. Choose extract location
4. The files will be extracted there
